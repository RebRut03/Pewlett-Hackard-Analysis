 ### Retirement Ready Mentors:
  - The question posed here is, are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
    - There are only 1,549 retirement-ready employees eligible to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.  This is only 2% compared to the number of retirement roles needing to be filled.  This does not seem to be a sufficient enough number to mentor the remaining employees, but it's likely that more analysis will need to be performed to determine this. 
    - It appears that only two managers are retiring, according to the retiring employees by title table, so that may be a positive thing since the managers likely have the established knowledge to pass on to subordinates, but on the flip side, they are losing quite a few skilled employees so that could put more responsibility on managers' shoulders.
    - Pewlett Hackard may want to consider broadening the mentor scope to include employees born in other years in addition to 1965.  For example, if they broadened the birth year scope of mentor employees to include one additional year, 1964, the number of eligible mentors will increase by 20%.
