# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Pewlett Hackard Analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis is:
- to determine the number of retiring employees per title, 
- to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program, and
- to write a summary report to help prepare Pewlett Hackard management for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

## Results: 
Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

## Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
