Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
There are only 1940 retire-ment ready employees eleibilbe to mentor the next generation Pewlett Hackard employees.  This is only 2% of the roles that need to be filled so I do not believe there are enough mentors avaialbe to prepare for these roles.  Pewlett Hackard may want to consider broadening the scope to include employees born in other years in addition to 1965 to help pick up the slack or offering incentives to retirment eligible employees who are Senior Staff and Engineers to come back as contractors for a certain amount of time to help with the mentoring.
